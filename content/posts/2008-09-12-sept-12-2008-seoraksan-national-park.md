**Sokcho / Seoraksan National Park**

Day 2 of hiking in the park. En route to the park by 9am after double checking to make sure the camera is there!

[<img src="http://the-jacksons.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/img_0703.jpg?w=225" alt="" border="0" />][1]The hike today is described as mostly easy with just 600m of hard hiking. We head off to Biseondae (Flying Fairy Peak) which is a veritical rock formation that stands at the entrance to a gorge. Very easy to get to this location, from there was start ascending to Geumganggul Cave. It is on Biseondae halfway up to the peak. It reportedly has a 649 stairs to the entrance. It&#8217;s a tough climb. When got to the cave entrace, we were greated with “It&#8217;s very nice to meet you”. A Korean couple was resting in the cave before coming down. They were a teacher and principal from Incheon who come here once a year. The were very nice and shared some food they had with us and beer. Luckily I had read about the etiquette of drinking with Koreans. 

If offered a glass, hold it while the beer is poured into the glass then drink it. Pass the glass back and fill it for the other person. It is apparently a sign of arrogance or self importance to fill your own glass.

It was a very civilized way to travel up, we were both pretty tired. There is more sun today than yesterday. It was a spectacular view as we ascended. We were going to try and find a waterfall but we don&#8217;t think we were able to get there from here. So we passed. Both of us were too tired to start another trail.

Travel day tomorrow off to Andong.
