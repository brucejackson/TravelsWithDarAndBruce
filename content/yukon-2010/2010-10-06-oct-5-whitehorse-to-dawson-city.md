    With out gift certificate in hand for our night at a brothel (okay- Dar will change this to former brothel), we head out for Dawson City. It&#8217;s 535km from Whitehorse. So, 5 hours drive &#8211; right? If you come from southern Ontario and think of the 401. But we are not in Kansas anymore.

    We have a leisurely start to the day that get confused when we decide to rearrange transportation. We rent a car for Joanne and her dad and we take Joanne&#8217;s RAV4. Boy are we glad we did that. The drive starts cloudy, clears up and then becomes winter! &nbsp;En route, we see 3 vehicles flipped in the ditch. &nbsp;We drove through blizzards and clouds! &nbsp; I guess that&#8217;s what happens when you drive another 500km north. &nbsp;

    For amusement, I turned the GPS on to see how far along we were. &nbsp;The program estimated that we would arrive at 9:23pm. &nbsp;We left Whitehorse at 1:20. &nbsp;This changes our approach to the trip. &nbsp;No more stopping at every scenic lookout. &nbsp;We will do that on the way home. &nbsp;Essential rest stops only. &nbsp;Luckily rest stops don&#8217;t have Tim Horton&#8217;s. &nbsp;They are a pull off from the highway and a couple of outhouses. &nbsp;At the fancy stops there is an interpretative display. &nbsp;We arrived 7:45pm.

    They were happy to see us at Bombay Peggy&#8217;s, mostly that we survived the drive. &nbsp;We checked into our room. &nbsp;As we check in we are told to help ourselves to the port and sherry in the parlour, it&#8217;s complimentary. &nbsp;We got takeout from the local greek restaurant as they were closing shortly. &nbsp;Our stay included 2 complimentary drinks at the hotel so we got two of their world famous martinis to go with our gyros!
