  A very early start today, we need to be on the road by 7am to reach Skagway by 9:15am Alaska Time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Luckily a time zone changes affords us some extra sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; We start in darkness heading south (after a Tim Horton’s stop) retracing the route to Carcross.&nbsp; Rather than the sun being in our eyes as we drive, the sun starts to light the mountains in front as we go.&nbsp;&nbsp; The route takes us from Yukon through British Columbia and over White Pass where we enter Alaska.&nbsp;The landscape in British Columbia is different. &nbsp;It has an eerie lunar appearance.&nbsp; Rocks covered in dark green moss and light green lichen.&nbsp; The trees as are sparse and stunted.&nbsp;&nbsp; It feels very “Group of Seven-ish”.&nbsp; </p>

  We arrive at the Border and get the usual questions: Where are you from? Where are you going? Any food with you? &nbsp;Anything else alive in the car other than the three of you?&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope not.

  Check-in for the ferry to Haines is 2 hours prior to departure.&nbsp; The ferry is part of the Alaska Maritime Highway and will head to Juneau after we get off in Haines.&nbsp; After check-in, we head for Historic Skagway.&nbsp; It is largely deserted.&nbsp; There are cars clustered in one area of the street around the Sweet Tooth Café; the only business open.&nbsp; Everything else is closed and the owners have headed south.&nbsp; The last cruise ship docked at Skagway on Sept 29<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; Skagway will be closed until the cruise ships return next year.&nbsp; The street is filled with Jewelry stores – high end gold and precious gems type of jewelry stores.&nbsp; The port can apparently handle around 6 cruise ships at one time bringing six to seven thousand tourists at once!&nbsp; We did see one non-Jewelry store that was having a BOGO sale for 2011 Sarah Palin Calendars and $5.95 Sarah Palin collector coins – limit 1 per customer!

  The clouds were low as we took the ferry to Haines, the day has been both rainy and clear at times.&nbsp; Rainbows are abundant.&nbsp; &nbsp;

  After checking in at the B&B that is located where Fort Seward once stood, we decided to go bear hunting – cameras only.&nbsp; Fort Seward was established during the periods when Canada and the US were having a minor dispute regarding the border in this area.&nbsp; The dispute was resolved through a treaty in 1903 – Hay-Herbert Treaty.&nbsp; The Canadian negotiators messed up on this one.&nbsp; Canada lost claim to some spectacular scenery and fishing resources.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

  The Chilkoot River is fed by the Chilkoot Lake.&nbsp; Sockeye and Coho spawn in Chilkoot Lake making the salmon run in the river popular for fly fishers, eagles and bears.&nbsp; Our first trip to the river saw a few Bald and Golden Eagles and a grizzly sow and 2 cubs, fishing near the mouth of the river.&nbsp; The cubs will fish a bit and wrestle with each other.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As we proceed up the river we see many more eagles, this area being called Valley of the Eagles.&nbsp; We watch wildlife for about an hour and then decide we are hungry.

  The owner of the B&B, Norm, had told us only a few restaurants are open and that the Chilkat Bakery has really good Thai food.&nbsp; We head there for some spice to warm up.&nbsp; Our plan is to head back to the river after some food and see if more bears come for dinner.&nbsp; The food is amazing and heats through and through.&nbsp; The food is washed down with apple pie and ice cream.&nbsp;

  The river has a “bear side” and a “human side”. &nbsp;&nbsp;Most bears and human respect this – but not all.&nbsp; Mostly humans are the transgressors.&nbsp; On our return trip the area is inundated by Eagles, sometimes 6 Bald Eagles sitting in a tree.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of our second visit to the river will have seen 15 bears (1 Black Bear, 1 older grizzly, 7 grizzly cubs and 6 grizzly adults). &nbsp;&nbsp;The bears are respecting the sides of the river.&nbsp; As long as they are one their side we can get out of the car and watch.&nbsp; A make shift telephoto lens (camera looking through binoculars) is used to get many photos.&nbsp; The protective nature of a mother grizzly is apparent.&nbsp; We watch the old grizzly as he gets ‘pushed’ around the river bank whenever a mother approaches with her cubs (within 100ft).&nbsp;&nbsp; As the mother and cubs got closer, the older grizzly would stand to observe.&nbsp; One of the cubs mimicked the behavior looking back at the old grizzly.&nbsp; The mother stood; the old grizzly darted off further downstream.&nbsp; &nbsp;

    As we turn the car to head back downstream, we spot bears on ‘our-side’ of the river.&nbsp; This means we are now confined to the car.&nbsp; We watch the bear fishing and running in the water.&nbsp;&nbsp; As they move behind a rock we move the car forward.&nbsp; There are now 4 cars jockeying for position to view bears.&nbsp; We know there is a mama bear with her 2 cubs close to us on our side of the river.&nbsp;&nbsp; My window is down.&nbsp; I am trying to spot them through the trees thinking they are close to the water’s edge.&nbsp; Joanne pulls the car up about 4 feet creating more of a space between us and the car behind.&nbsp; Suddenly the mother is about 10 feet way from the side of the car, underneath the tree that is just beside the car.&nbsp; She is headed this way quickly.&nbsp; (I like power windows, that window came up so quickly).&nbsp; The mother darted between the two cars followed by her two cubs and they disappeared up the side of the hill to our left.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

  A day of wildlife watching ends with a bit of culture.&nbsp; South Pacific is being staged by the local community theatre.&nbsp; While at the bakery everyone was talking about ‘the show tonight’.&nbsp; We had stopped at the IGA in town and looked at the poster.&nbsp; We were subsequently told we had to go by a local – it was sold out the previous night. &nbsp;&nbsp;It was quite good; unfortunately, we were all exhausted from the early start and the day’s adventures that we decided we shouldn’t stay past the first intermission.&nbsp; We need to rent the movie to see how it ends!

  <i><b>Final Note:&nbsp; Joanne feels very guilty to have seen all this wildlife today since she saw nothing when her daughter Jessica visited.</b></i>
