The minute you walk outside you can feel that the pace and lifestyle is more relaxed. &nbsp;We started the day with a brief hunt for an iPhone charging cable which Bruce forgot. &nbsp;The first store we tried didn’t have one but got directed to The Source beside the Wal-Mart, close to the Canadian Tire. &nbsp;As those stores were the wrong direction we carried on to Downtown Whitehorse. &nbsp;We strolled down by the Yukon River and soon realized we were getting hungry. 

We stopped at [Baked][1], a local bakery/coffee shop and really busy place. &nbsp;The menu board advertises a winter special: &nbsp;30 cents off any hot drink whenever the temperature dips below -30C. &nbsp; 

Refreshed with coffee and food we carried on to the Whitehorse Visitors Center to find out what is still open – we are travelling off season. &nbsp;Some plans have changed but we won’t spoil the surprise. &nbsp;The information center runs on its own schedule. &nbsp;Behind the counter a digital sign told us that the next showing of a movie was in 14 minutes. &nbsp;We asked what the movie was: As the crow flies was the response, but we won’t make you wait 14 minutes, we can start it now if you want… &nbsp;The film offered some fabulous views of the Yukon from a Crow’s perspective.

After the film we carried our walk along the Yukon River going upstream. &nbsp;We passed the SS Klondike, a National Historic Site. &nbsp; It is now lunch time in Whitehorse and the path has a steady stream of walkers and runners on it. &nbsp;We carry on upstream the wind is in our face and it chills, though not clean through to the bone. &nbsp;The highway to our right is the Robert Service Way. &nbsp;A series of interpretative signs tell us we are on the [Millennium Trail][2]. &nbsp;A 5km loop along both sides of the river. &nbsp;We decide to walk the whole trail enjoying the smell of fall leaves and the chatter of wildlife (squirrels).

After the walk we were both parched. &nbsp;Based on the precipitation we are told that Whitehorse is a desert climate. We were warned we would be thirsty. After quenching our thirst we carried on shopping. &nbsp;This time we go to the original Coast Mountain Sports. &nbsp;Turns out Bruce also forgot his gortex shell.  
We eventually found the charging cable at Staples; we found it before The Source. &nbsp;Close to Staples was a Coffee and Tea shop. &nbsp;We decided to pop in. &nbsp;As soon as we went in we found a product we have been looking for: eCloth. &nbsp;Can’t find it in Ottawa; found it in Whitehorse. &nbsp;Friends swear by it for cleaning windows and our windows at home desperately need it. 

Now we had heard about a set of stairs, the Black Street Stairs. &nbsp;They connect the downtown with the trails that lead around the airport. Frequently used by runners for training. &nbsp; Joanne has complained about it on Facebook and [we read about][3] (scroll down on link) the stairs before heading to the Yukon. &nbsp;It was something we had to experience. &nbsp;Today we walked the stairs. &nbsp;Soon we will run them. &nbsp;They will be tough.

Once Joanne got home and had a chance to relax – we all headed out to dinner at a local restaurant and called it an early night as none of us really had a full night’s sleep last night.
