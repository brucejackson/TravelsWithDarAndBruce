No wildlife today. &nbsp;Museums are closed. 

That means only one thing. &nbsp;Darlene gets to go shopping. &nbsp;We spend more of our time at the North End Gallery. [www.northendgallery.ca][1] &nbsp; We have some new are for the living room! &nbsp;We are not spoiling the surprise by posting the pictures online. &nbsp;You have to visit us in Ottawa to see it!
