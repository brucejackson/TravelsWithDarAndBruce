  We are off to an exciting start: a pat down at airport security (not as invasive as you might think) and an unconfirmed sighting of Jean Chretien in the Ottawa airport!<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span>So far so good but should be a long day with 3 flights to go!

  It was a long day â€“ but awesome to see our friend Joanne waiting for us in the Whitehorse airport at 12:21 am (Whitehorse Time = 3:21 am Ottawa time).<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We were quite sleepy but managed a quick driving tour of Whitehorse and a beer then off to bed.
