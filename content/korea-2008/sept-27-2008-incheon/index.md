It&#8217;s 1:30pm in Korea.&nbsp; We are sitting at the airport terminal waiting for a flight home.&nbsp; We board in about 25minutes.&nbsp; Unlike Canadian airports who charge for internet access, the airport here gives it away, so we publish one final update.

We arrived at the airport a fair bit early for our flight and have been rewarded with emergency exit seats so we have lots of leg room!!
